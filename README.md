## 🎯 Introduction

This project extracts, interprets, and refines regulatory reporting instructions to identify key data validation requirements. It ensures compliance with financial regulations by automating the identification of data quality issues before submission. The system helps reduce manual effort, minimize reporting errors, and improve the consistency of regulatory filings.

Key features include:

- A JSON file defining validation rules for each column and allowable values.

- A sample dataset adhering to the defined schema.

- A Python script to validate the dataset against the rules.

- Comprehensive error reporting and logging to facilitate troubleshooting.

- Extensible rule definitions, allowing new regulatory requirements to be incorporated seamlessly.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
1. **Difficulty in Parsing Large Files:** One of the primary challenges was effectively parsing very large files. Large Language Models (LLMs) face issues when dealing with such large data. It is essential to parse this extensive information without losing crucial details, which demands sophisticated methods and technologies.
2. **Test Data Generation:** Another major hurdle was the generation of test data that accurately reflected real-world scenarios. This process was complex as it needed to ensure the test data was comprehensive and representative, allowing us to thoroughly validate our solutions and predict potential issues.
3. **Rule Generation from Data:** Creating rules from the collected data was also a challenging task. This required deep analysis and understanding of the data patterns to develop accurate rules that could support decision-making processes and enhance system functionality.

## 🏃 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend:
   ```sh
   cd code/src
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install Node.js dependencies for the React frontend:
   ```sh
   cd ../ui
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI backend:
   ```sh
   cd ../../code/src
   uvicorn api:app --reload
   ```

5. In a separate terminal, start the React frontend:
   ```sh
   cd ../ui
   npm start
   ```

Note: Make sure you have Python and Node.js installed on your system before running these commands. The backend runs on port 8000 and the frontend runs on port 3000.
