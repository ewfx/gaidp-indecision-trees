## 🎯 Introduction

This project extracts, interprets, and refines regulatory reporting instructions to identify key data validation requirements. It ensures compliance with financial regulations by automating the identification of data quality issues before submission. The system helps reduce manual effort, minimize reporting errors, and improve the consistency of regulatory filings.

Key features include:

- A JSON file defining validation rules for each column and allowable values.

- A sample dataset adhering to the defined schema.

- A Python script to validate the dataset against the rules.

- Comprehensive error reporting and logging to facilitate troubleshooting.

- Extensible rule definitions, allowing new regulatory requirements to be incorporated seamlessly.

## 🏃 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend:
   ```sh
   cd code/src
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install Node.js dependencies for the React frontend:
   ```sh
   cd ../ui
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI backend:
   ```sh
   cd ../../code/src
   uvicorn api:app --reload
   ```

5. In a separate terminal, start the React frontend:
   ```sh
   cd ../ui
   npm start
   ```

Note: Make sure you have Python and Node.js installed on your system before running these commands. The backend runs on port 8000 and the frontend runs on port 3000.
